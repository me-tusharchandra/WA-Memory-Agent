# WhatsApp Memory Assistant

## Application Scenario
Imagine you start your day by greeting your personal AI via WhatsApp. You send a photo of your new haircut, record a voice note about your to-dos, and send a text note listing grocery items. Days later, you ask "What did I plan for dinner?" or "Show me my hairstyle update from last week," and the bot retrieves the relevant memories.

## Overview
Build a WhatsApp chatbot using Twilio's WhatsApp API and Mem0's memory layer to ingest and recall images, audio, and text as memories. The bot should support natural language queries and a command to list all saved memories.

Additionally, design and implement your own database schema to persist interactions and derived memories, and use it to power listing, filtering, and simple analytics.

## Objectives
- **Multimodal Ingestion**: Accept and process images, voice notes, and text messages.
- **Persistent Memory**: Store entries in Mem0 with metadata and embeddings for fast, semantic retrieval.
- **Database Persistence (your design)**: Capture user interactions and memories in a database you choose. Demonstrate idempotent ingestion, media deduplication, and timezone-aware queries.
- **Interactive Chat**: Handle conversational queries using context awareness.
- **Memory Listing**: Implement a `/list` command to enumerate all user memories.
- **DB-backed Queries & Analytics**: Provide endpoints for recent interactions and a small analytics summary using your database.
- **Innovative Features**: Creative freedom (e.g., mood detection, geo-tagging, scheduled reminders, or group memory sharing etc.)

## Tasks

### ðŸ“± Twilio Integration
- Provision a Twilio sandbox number for WhatsApp.
- Configure webhooks to receive inbound messages and fetch media URLs.

### ðŸ”§ Backend Service
- Set up a Python based service.
- Install and configure the Mem0 SDK with API key.
- Add a database layer (SQLite, Postgres, or similar) with migrationsâ€”design the schema yourself to store:
  - Users and their WhatsApp identity.
  - Inbound messages (text, image, audio), media metadata, and any transcripts.
  - The memories you create (and their linkage to source interactions and Mem0).

**Required behaviors** (implementation details are up to you):
- **Idempotent ingestion**: processing the same Twilio message twice must not create duplicates (use a stable dedup key).
- **Media deduplication**: identical media should be stored once and re-referenced (use a repeatable content fingerprint).
- **Linkage**: each memory should be traceable to its originating interaction.
- **Timezone-aware filtering**: support queries like "last week" in the user's timezone.

**Create endpoints:**
- `POST /webhook` to handle incoming messages.
- `POST /memories` to add multimodal memories.
- `GET /memories?query=<text>` to search memories (via Mem0 and enrich responses with your DB).
- `GET /memories/list` to return all memories (read from your DB, newest first).
- **NEW** `GET /interactions/recent?limit=<n>` to return recent interactions from your DB.
- **NEW** `GET /analytics/summary` to return simple DB-derived stats (e.g., totals by type, top tags/labels if you use them, last ingest time).

### ðŸŽ¯ Multimodal Processing
- **Images**: Use Mem0 to create memories from images; persist media metadata and memory linkage in your DB.
- **Audio**: Download, transcribe with Whisper, persist the transcript in your DB, and create a memory via Mem0.
- **Text**: Directly ingest to Mem0; also persist the original interaction in your DB.

### ðŸ’¼ Business Logic & Chat Flows
- On message receipt, detect type, persist interaction, and add a memory.
- On query, search Mem0 and format responses; include DB details (when/where it came from, any labels/tags you store).
- On `/list`, return memories from your DB.
- Ensure idempotency and media dedup in ingestion.
- Handle basic errors and edge cases gracefully.

### ðŸŽ¬ Demo
- Record a 3-5 min demo: ingesting media, querying by intent, listing memories.
- Show DB usage live: call `/interactions/recent` and `/analytics/summary`.

### ðŸ“š Documentation
- **README**: Setup steps for Twilio, environment variables, deployment.
- **API reference**: Endpoint definitions and sample payloads.
- **Schema overview (your design)**: brief ERD or diagram, key constraints, and why you chose them.
- **Notes on idempotency/dedup/timezone handling**: explain your approach.

## Deliverables
- Public GitHub repo with server and any client code.
- Demo video link (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.).
- Comprehensive README with setup, usage, and architecture.
- Database migrations/DDL and a small seed script (your schema).

## Evaluation Criteria
- **End-to-End Functionality**: Successful memory ingestion and retrieval; natural WhatsApp UX.
- **Code Quality**: Readable, maintainable, with proper error handling.
- **API & Data Design**: Clear payloads and a coherent schema of your own design; idempotent ingestion and media dedup working.
- **DB Queries & Listing**: `/memories/list` reads from your DB; `/interactions/recent` and `/analytics/summary` are correct and responsive.
- **UI/UX via WhatsApp**: Clear, helpful responses and prompts.
- **Innovation**: Creative features beyond the basics.
- **Documentation & Demo**: Clarity, completeness, and professionalism.
